<!-- HTML establishes how a web application will look (think of it as foundation) and can include basic logic, this page extends from index, index will establish the look across all the pages, then individual HTML pages will decide the differences page to page -->
{% extends "base.html" %}
{% block content %}
This will be the home page. Depending on our UX we might have a dashboard here showing some stats for example.
